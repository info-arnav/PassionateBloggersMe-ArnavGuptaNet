with-callback\n\nA small helper function to bridge the gap when returning a promise from a function that takes a callback\n\n\nNote that this module will not introduce any custom Promise

withCallback returns a promise and invokes the function with a callback\n// used to fulfill the promise\nfunction readFile(name) {\n  return withCallback(callback => fs.readFile(name,

map all arguments\n// passed to the callback to a single value used to resolve the promise.\nfunction example(callback) {\n  callback(null, 'a', 'b');\n}\nconst promise = withCallback(example, (a, b)
