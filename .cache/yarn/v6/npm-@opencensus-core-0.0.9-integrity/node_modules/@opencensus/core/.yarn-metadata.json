It currently includes 3 apis: stats, tracing and tags.\n\nThe library is in alpha stage and the API is subject to change.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall the opencensus-core package with NPM:\n```bash\nnpm install @opencensus/core\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n#### Get the global Stats manager instance.\n\nTo enable metrics, we’ll import a few items from OpenCensus Core package.\n\n```javascript\nconst { globalStats, MeasureUnit, AggregationType, TagMap } = require('@opencensus/core');\n\n// The latency in milliseconds\nconst mLatencyMs = globalStats.createMeasureDouble(\n  \"repl/latency\",\n  MeasureUnit.MS,\n  \"The latency in milliseconds\"\n);\n```\n\n#### Create Views and Tags:\n\nWe now determine how our metrics will be organized by creating ```Views```. We will also create the variable needed to add extra text meta-data to our metrics – ```methodTagKey```, ```statusTagKey```, and ```errorTagKey```.\n\n```javascript\nconst methodTagKey = { name: \"method\" };\nconst statusTagKey = { name: \"status\" };\nconst errorTagKey = { name: \"error\" };\n\n// Create & Register the view.\nconst latencyView = globalStats.createView(\n  \"demo/latency\",\n  mLatencyMs,\n  AggregationType.DISTRIBUTION,\n  [methodTagKey, statusTagKey, errorTagKey],\n  \"The distribution of the latencies\",\n  // Bucket Boundaries:\n  // [>=0ms, >=25ms, >=50ms, >=75ms, >=100ms, >=200ms, >=400ms, >=600ms, >=800ms, >=1s, >=2s, >=4s, >=6s]\n  [0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 2000, 4000, 6000]\n);\nglobalStats.registerView(latencyView);\n```\n\n#### Recording Metrics:\n\nNow we will record the desired metrics. To do so, we will use ```globalStats.record()``` and pass in measurements.\n\n```javascript\nconst [_, startNanoseconds] = process.hrtime();\nconst tags = new TagMap();\ntags.set(methodTagKey, { value: \"REPL\" });\ntags.set(statusTagKey, { value: \"OK\" });\n\nglobalStats.record([{\n  measure: mLatencyMs,\n  value: sinceInMilliseconds(startNanoseconds)\n}], tags);\n\nfunction sinceInMilliseconds(startNanoseconds) {\n  const [_, endNanoseconds] = process.hrtime();\n  return (endNanoseconds - startNanoseconds) / 1e6;\n}\n```\n\nMeasures can be of type `Int64` or `DOUBLE`, created by calling `createMeasureInt64` and `createMeasureDouble` respectively. Its units can be:\n\n| MeasureUnit | Usage |\n| ----------- | ----- |\n| `UNIT` | for general counts |\n| `BYTE` | bytes |\n| `KBYTE` | Kbytes |\n| `SEC` | seconds |\n| `MS` | millisecond |\n| `NS` | nanosecond |\n\nViews can have agregations of type `SUM`, `LAST_VALUE`, `COUNT` and `DISTRIBUTION`.
