If `instanceClone` is not specified, it will not attempt to clone non-plain objects, and will copy the object reference.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)\n\n```sh\n$ npm i clone-deep --save\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar cloneDeep = require('clone-deep');\n\nvar obj = {a: 'b'};\nvar arr = [obj];\n\nvar copy = cloneDeep(arr);\nobj.c = 'd';\n\nconsole.log(copy);\n//=> [{a: 'b'}]\n\nconsole.log(arr);\n//=> [{a: 'b', c: 'd'}]\n```\n\n## Other object utils\n\n* [assign-deep](https://www.npmjs.com/package/assign-deep): Deeply assign the enumerable properties and/or es6 Symbol properies of source objects to the target… [more](https://www.npmjs.com/package/assign-deep) | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/assign-deep)\n* [extend-shallow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extend-shallow): Extend an object with the properties of additional objects. node.js/javascript util. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/extend-shallow)\n* [merge-deep](https://www.npmjs.com/package/merge-deep): Recursively merge values in a javascript object. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/merge-deep)\n* [mixin-deep](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mixin-deep): Deeply mix the properties of objects into the first object.
