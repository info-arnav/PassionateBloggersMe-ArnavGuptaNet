If the reference is gone, it meant no one else was pointing to the object.\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\nlet reference = {};\n\nconst detector = new LeakDetector(reference);\n\n// Reference is held in memory.\nconsole.log(detector.isLeaking()); // true\n\n// We destroy the only reference to the object.\nreference = null;\n\n// Reference is gone.\nconsole.log(detector.isLeaking()); // false\n```\n",
