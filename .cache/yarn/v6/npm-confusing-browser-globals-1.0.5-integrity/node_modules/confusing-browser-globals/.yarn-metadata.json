    "readme": "# confusing-browser-globals\n\nA curated list of browser globals that commonly cause confusion and are not recommended to use without an explicit `window.` qualifier.\n\n## Motivation\n\nSome global variables in browser are likely to be used by people without the intent of using them as globals, such as `status`, `name`, `event`, etc.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\nhandleClick() { // missing `event` argument\n  this.setState({\n  \ttext: event.target.value // uses the `event` global: oops!\n  });\n}\n```\n\nThis package exports a list of globals that are often used by mistake. You can feed this list to a static analysis tool like ESLint to prevent their usage without an explicit `window.` qualifier.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install --save confusing-browser-globals\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nIf you use Create React App, you don't need to configure anything, as this rule is already included in the default `eslint-config-react-app` preset.\n\nIf you maintain your own ESLint configuration, you can do this:\n\n```js\nvar restrictedGlobals = require('confusing-browser-globals');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  rules: {\n    'no-restricted-globals': ['error'].concat(restrictedGlobals),\n  },\n};\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
