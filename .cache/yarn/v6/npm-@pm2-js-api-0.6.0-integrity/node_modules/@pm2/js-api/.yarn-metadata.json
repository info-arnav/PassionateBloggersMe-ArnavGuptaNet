    "readme": "# PM2.io API Client for Javascript\n\nThis module lets you implement a fully customizable PM2.io client, receiving live data from the PM2.io API.\n\n## Install\n\nWith NPM:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install @pm2/js-api --save\n```\n\nOr get the raw library for browser here:\n\n[https://unpkg.com/@pm2/js-api](https://unpkg.com/@pm2/js-api)\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use this client you need to first requiring it into your code and creating a new instance :\n\n```javascript\nconst PM2IO = require('@pm2/js-api')\n\nlet client = new PM2IO()\n```\n\nThen you'll to tell the client how you want to authenticate, you have the choice :\n\n- First the `standalone` flow, you just need to enter a refresh token and it will works\n```javascript\nclient.use('standalone', {\n  refresh_token: 'token'\n})\n```\n\n- Secondly, the `browser` flow, you have a custom keymetrics application and you want to authenticate of the behalf for any user (in this flow you need to be inside a browser) :\n```javascript\nclient.use('browser', {\n  client_id: 'my-oauth-client-id'\n})\n```\n\n- Thirdly, the `embed` flow, you have a custom keymetrics application and you want to authenticate of the behalf of any user (you need to be in a nodejs process, for example a CLI) :\n```javascript\nclient.use('embed', {\n  client_id: 'my-oauth-client-id'\n})\n```\n\nAfter that, you can do whatever call you want just keep in mind each call return a Promise (the client will handle authentication) :\n```javascript\nclient.user.retrieve()\n  .then((response) => {\n   // see https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios#response-schema\n   // for the content of response\n  }).catch((err) => {\n   // see https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios#handling-errors\n   // for the content of err\n  })\n```\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\nconst PM2IO = require('@pm2/js-api')\n\nlet client = new PM2IO().use('standalone', {\n  refresh_token: 'token'\n})\n\n// retrieve our buckets\nclient.bucket.retrieveAll()\n  .then((res) => {\n    // find our bucket\n    let bucket = res.data.find(bucket => bucket.name === 'Keymetrics')\n\n    // connect to realtime data of a bucket\n    client.realtime.subscribe(bucket._id).catch(console.error)\n\n    // attach handler on specific realtime data\n    client.realtime.on(`${bucket.public_id}:connected`, () => console.log('connected to realtime'))\n    client.realtime.on(`${bucket.public_id}:*:status`, (data) => console.log(data.server_name))\n\n    // we can also unsubscribe from a bucket realtime data\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      client.realtime.unsubscribe(bucket._id).catch(console.error)\n    }, 5000)\n  })\n  .catch(console.error)\n```\n\n### Realtime\n\nAll realtime data are broadcasted with the following pattern :\n\n```\nbucket_public_id:server_name:data_method\n```\n\nFor example :\n\n```javascript\n// here i listen on the status data for\n// the server \"my_server\" on the bucket with\n// the public id 4398545\nclient.realtime.on(`4398545:my_server:status`, (data) => {\n  console.log(data.server_name))\n}\n```\n\n#### Events available\n\n| Event | Description

2.0\n\n## Release\n\n## Release\n\nTo release a new version, first install [gren](https://github.com/github-tools/github-release-notes) :\n```bash\nyarn global add github-release-notes\n```\n\nPush a commit in github with the new version you want to release :\n```\ngit commit -am \"version: major|minor|patch bump to X.X.X\"\n```\n\nCare for the **versionning**, we use the [semver versioning](https://semver.org/) currently. Please be careful about the version when pushing a new package.\n\nThen tag a version with git :\n```bash\ngit tag -s vX.X.X\n```\n\nPush the tag into github (this will trigger the publish to npm) :\n```\ngit push origin vX.X.X\n```\n\nTo finish update the changelog of the release on github with `gren` (be sure that gren has selected the right tags):\n```\ngren release -o -D commits -u keymetrics -r pm2-io-js-api\n```\n",

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
