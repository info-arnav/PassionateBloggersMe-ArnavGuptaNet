    "readme": "# react-app-polyfill\n\nThis package includes polyfills for various browsers.\nIt includes minimum requirements and commonly used language features used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) projects.\n\n### Features\n\nEach polyfill ensures the following language features are present:\n\n1. `Promise` (for `async` / `await` support)\n1. `window.fetch` (a Promise-based way to make web requests in the browser)\n1. `Object.assign` (a helper required for Object Spread, i.e. `{ ...a, ...b }`)\n1. `Symbol` (a built-in object used by `for...of` syntax and friends)\n1. `Array.from` (a built-in static method used by array spread, i.e. `[...arr]`)\n\n### Usage\n\nFirst, install the package using Yarn or npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install react-app-polyfill\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\nyarn add react-app-polyfill\n```\n\nNow, you can import the entry point for the minimal version you intend to support. For example, if you import the IE9 entry point, this will include IE10 and IE11 support.\n\n#### Internet Explorer 9\n\n```js\n// This must be the first line in src/index.js\nimport 'react-app-polyfill/ie9';\n\n// ...\n```\n\n#### Internet Explorer 11\n\n```js\n// This must be the first line in src/index.js\nimport 'react-app-polyfill/ie11';\n\n// ...\n```\n",
