    "readme": "Utilities for determining whether characters belong to character classes defined\nby the XML specs.\n\n## Organization\n\nIt used to be that the library was contained in a single file and you could just\nimport/require/what-have-you the `xmlchars` module. However, that setup did not\nwork well for people who cared about code optimization. Importing `xmlchars`\nmeant importing *all* of the library and because of the way the code was\ngenerated there was no way to shake the resulting code tree.\n\nSince version 1.3.0, importing `xmlchars` is deprecated. Instead, you should\ndirectly load the file from `xmlchars/lib` that you care about. Even without\ntree shaking being used, this results in a smaller footprint.\n\nDifferent modules cover different standards. At the time this documentation was\nlast updated, we had:\n\n* `xmlchars/xml/1.0/ed5` which covers XML 1.0 edition 5.\n* `xmlchars/xml/1.0/ed4` which covers XML 1.0 edition 4.\n* `xmlchars/xmlns/1.0/ed3` which covers XML Namespaces 1.0 edition 3.\n\n## Features\n\nThe \"things\" each module contains can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. \"Fragments\": these are parts and pieces of regular expressions that\ncorrespond to the productions defined in the standard that the module\ncovers. You'd use these to *build regular expressions*.\n\n2. Regular expressions that correspond to the productions defined in the\nstandard that the module covers.\n\n3. Lists: these are arrays of characters that correspond to the productions.\n\n4. Functions that test code points to verify whether they fit a production.\n",
