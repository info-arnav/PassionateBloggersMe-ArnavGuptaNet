Select or create a Cloud Platform project.\n\n    [Go to the projects page][projects]\n\n1.  Enable billing for your project.\n\n    [Enable billing][billing]\n\n1.  [Set up authentication with a service account][auth] so you can access the\n    API from your local workstation.\n\n[projects]: https://console.cloud.google.com/project\n[billing]: https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6293499#enable-billing\n[auth]: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started\n\n### Installing the package\n\n    npm install --save googleapis-common\n\nIt's unlikely you will need to install this package directly, as it will be\ninstalled as a dependency when you install other `@google` packages.\n\n## Versioning\n\nThis library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).\n\nThis library is considered to be in **alpha**. This means it is still a\nwork-in-progress and under active development. Any release is subject to\nbackwards-incompatible changes at any time.\n\nMore Information: [Google Cloud Platform Launch Stages][launch_stages]\n\n[launch_stages]: https://cloud.google.com/terms/launch-stages\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions welcome!

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
